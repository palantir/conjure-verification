    Add support for aarch64

    This causes a breaking change for any direct consumers as the
    coordinates for the osx bundle will be changing such that there
    is now a:

    osx-x86_64 package

    and

    osx-aarch64 package

    This adds a bit more safety to ensure that consumers don't inadvertently
    grab the incorrect package.

    Also bump the rust version to 1.54.0. Versions prior to 1.49.0 do not have support for aarch64. I arbitrarily picked 1.54.0 even though 1.63.0 was just published since I didn't want to go too bleeding edge.
